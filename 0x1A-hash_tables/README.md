 hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure used in computer programming for efficiently storing and retrieving key-value pairs. It is designed to provide fast access to values associated with unique keys. Hash tables are widely used in various programming languages and are essential for tasks like data indexing, caching, and implementing associative arrays.

Here's how a hash table works:

Hash Function: A hash table uses a hash function to map each unique key to an index in an array or a bucket. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a fixed-size numeric value (hash code or hash value) that corresponds to the index where the associated value will be stored. The goal is to distribute keys uniformly across the available slots to minimize collisions (two different keys hashing to the same index).

Array or Bucket: Hash tables typically use an array of buckets, where each bucket is a data structure (usually a linked list, array, or another hash table) that can store one or more key-value pairs. The index produced by the hash function determines which bucket the key-value pair will be stored in.

Insertion: To insert a key-value pair into the hash table, the hash function is applied to the key to determine the index. If the bucket at that index is empty, the key-value pair is added to it. If the bucket is not empty, which is called a collision, one of several collision resolution techniques can be used to handle the situation. Common techniques include chaining (using linked lists to store multiple values at the same index) and open addressing (probing other slots until an empty one is found).

Retrieval: To retrieve a value associated with a key, the hash function is applied to the key to determine the index. The data structure at that index (e.g., linked list) is then searched to find the key-value pair with the matching key.
